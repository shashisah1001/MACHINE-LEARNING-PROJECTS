# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECTS
This project is completed using Machine Learning Model (SVM:SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE)using Python and its dependencies like Pandas, Numpy , Sklearn etc.
Data is taken from Kaggle (Pima Indians Diabetes Database)
 To predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
ALL the coding is done using Google Colab.
